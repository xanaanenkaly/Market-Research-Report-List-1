<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refractive Type</li><li>Diffraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Multifocal Intraocular Lens (IOL) market is primarily categorized into two types: refractive and diffraction types. Refractive multifocal lenses use different lens powers to provide clear vision at varying distances, enhancing visual acuity for patients with presbyopia. In contrast, diffraction-type lenses utilize a series of concentric rings that split light into multiple focal points, allowing for simultaneous vision at multiple distances. Both types aim to reduce the dependency on glasses and improve the quality of life for cataract patients.</p></p>
