<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro Stimulation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Device</li><li>External Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurostimulation equipment market is divided into two main types: implantable devices and external devices. Implantable devices, such as deep brain stimulators and spinal cord stimulators, are surgically placed within the body to manage chronic pain, movement disorders, and other neurological conditions. In contrast, external devices, like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS) and wearable neuromodulation systems, are used on the bodyâ€™s surface to provide non-invasive therapy. Both types aim to enhance neuronal activity and improve patient quality of life.</p></p>
