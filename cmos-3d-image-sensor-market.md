<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS 3D Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backside-illuminated(BSI)</li><li>BSI Stacked</li><li>Front-illuminated(FI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS 3D image sensor market features three main types: Backside-Irradiated (BSI), BSI Stacked, and Front-Irradiated (FI). BSI sensors enhance light sensitivity by placing the photodiode at the back, improving image quality in low light. BSI Stacked sensors take this further by stacking additional layers for enhanced functionality and performance, ideal for advanced applications. In contrast, Front-Irradiated sensors have their photodiodes on the front but may struggle in low-light conditions, making them less favored for high-performance needs.</p></p>
