<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgery Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopole Electrosurgical Generator</li><li>Bipolar Electrosurgical Generator</li><li>Vessel Sealing Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrosurgery generator market comprises three main types: monopole electrosurgical generators, bipolar electrosurgical generators, and vessel sealing generators. Monopole generators utilize a single active electrode, creating tissue cutting and coagulation by transferring current through the patient. Bipolar generators employ two electrodes for localized coagulation, minimizing collateral damage. Vessel sealing generators specifically target blood vessels, using controlled thermal energy to seal tissues effectively, thus preventing bleeding. Each type caters to different surgical needs, enhancing precision and safety in procedures.</p></p>
