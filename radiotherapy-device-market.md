<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiotherapy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiotherapy device market is primarily categorized into two types: external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) devices and internal beam radiotherapy (IBRT) devices. EBRT devices deliver targeted radiation from outside the body, utilizing technologies like linear accelerators and conventional machines to treat various cancers without invasive procedures. In contrast, IBRT devices, such as brachytherapy systems, administer radiation from within the body, placing radioactive sources directly at the tumor site. Both types aim to effectively destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.</p></p>
