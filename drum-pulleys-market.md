<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drum Pulleys Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Support Pulley</li><li>Drive Pulley</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drum pulleys are vital components in conveyor systems, classified into two primary market types: support pulleys and drive pulleys. Support pulleys, often referred to as take-up or idler pulleys, maintain tension in the conveyor belt and guide its movement. Drive pulleys, on the other hand, are powered by a motor to facilitate the belt's motion, propelling materials along the conveyor. Both types are essential for efficient material handling in industries such as mining, manufacturing, and logistics.</p></p>
